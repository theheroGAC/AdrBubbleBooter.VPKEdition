## ‚úÖ Compatibility

*   **Requires:** A PS Vita (PCH-1000 or PCH-2000) or PS TV (VTE-1000) with custom firmware (HENkaku/enso).
*   **Requires:** [Adrenaline](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/Adrenaline) v6.0 or later and the `661.PBP` firmware file.

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites
1.  Ensure **Adrenaline** is installed and working correctly on your device.
2.  Make sure the `661.PBP` file is placed in the correct location (usually `ux0:app/PSPEMUCFW/`).

### Installing the Booter
1.  Copy the `AdrBubbleBooterInstaller.vpk` file to the root of your Vita's `ux0:` partition.
2.  Use a homebrew app like VitaShell to browse to the file and install it.
3.  Run the **AdrBubbleBooterInstaller** bubble once to install the necessary files.
4.  *(Optional but recommended)*: Reboot your PS Vita for all changes to take effect.
5.  You can now delete the `AdrBubbleBooterInstaller.vpk` and its bubble.

## üéÆ Usage

### Creating Bubbles
To create a bubble for a specific game or homebrew:
1.  On your PC, run `AdrBubbleBooterCreator.exe`.
2.  Fill in the required fields (e.g., path to the game file, title ID, name, icon image).
3.  Click the "Create" button to generate a `.vpk` file.
4.  Transfer this `.vpk` file to your Vita and install it like any other homebrew. A new bubble will appear on your LiveArea.

### Configuration
Each bubble can be configured individually:
1.  Boot the game from its newly created bubble.
2.  Open the **Adrenaline menu** (usually by pressing the **PS button** + **Select**).
3.  Navigate to the **"Booter"** tab.
4.  Adjust the settings to your preference (CPU speed, auto-load state, etc.).
5.  Exit the menu to save the configuration for that specific bubble.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

*   **"Adrenaline couldn't find the 661.PBP"**: Ensure Adrenaline is fully installed and working on its own first.
*   **Game doesn't boot**: Double-check the file path used in the Bubble Creator. The game file must be accessible from the Vita (e.g., in `ux0:pspemu/ISO/`).
*   **Bubble crashes**: Try rebuilding the database via Safe Mode (hold POWER + PS + R Shoulder buttons on boot).
